Project Euler Solutions
==========================


Herein lies my solutions to Project Euler problems.

The code (mostly Python, for now) is under src, with the files stored in subdirectories created for every bin of 10 problems (i.e. 1-10, 11-20, etc.)

The code files are named by the problem number: so, *problem1.py*, for example, is the solution for problem 1.  Generally, I have tried to comment the code as well as possible, and include a standard way of printing to stdout at the end of each program.

The data files I don't have organized by problem for now.  I will update this once I get around to it and include information on which code has a dependency on which data file, etc.
