Project Euler
==========================


Some solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems.  Goal is to get at least 100.  We'll see.

The first 10 problem solutions are under src/ (before I switched to using Python).  The rest of the code is in the python/ directory, the file name containing the problem number.

The data/ directory contains the input files used (when necessary).
