Problem 15

Starting in the top left corner of a 2x2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20x20 grid?



So, this one was done by hand.  Wound up thinking of it as a binomial coefficient problem.  
Turn the lattice 45 degrees to think of it as a diamond (more natural "flow" down the network).
Pascal's triangle gives the binomial coefficients.

                       1
					 1	 1
					1  2  1
				   1  3 3  1
				  1 4  6  4 1
				 ..............
				 
And that center coefficient (i.e. center of even rows, the ones with odd # of values)
is (2n choose n) where n constitutes the dimensions of the lattice.

=> paths on 20x20 grid is (40 choose 20) = 137846528820
